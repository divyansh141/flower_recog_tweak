# Flower Recognition
I have created a system in which the system will automatically tweak the code to get desired Accuracy and it will send a email notification regarding desired Accuracy.

# My Setup:
I have used-
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Docker in Redhat
3. Jenkins

# Use of convo.py file:
This file will be used to tweak convolution layer

# Use of dense.py file:
This file will be used to tweak Dense layer

# Use of accuracy.txt:
In this file, obtained accuracy will be stored. These stored accuracies will be used compare older and newer accuracy and whenever newer accuarcy will reach to desired accuracy. The program will stop.

# Use of email.py:
This file will send a email notification after getting desired accuracy.

# flower_recg.py:
This is the main program file.
